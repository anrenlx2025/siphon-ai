//! HEP3 (Homer) shipping for SiphonAI.
//!
//! Assembles a single [`hep_rs::UdpHepSink`] from `[hep]` config,
//! installs it as the global emitter for `sip-hep` (SIP signaling
//! capture inside siphon-rs) and `forge-hep` (RTCP + RTP-QoS inside
//! forge-media), and exposes a small SiphonAI-owned API for the
//! application-layer chunks Homer also renders:
//!
//! - `HepProtocol::Log` (0x64): one short text line when a bridged call
//!   starts and one when it ends, inbound and outbound alike. Carries
//!   the SIP Call-ID as the correlation chunk so Homer threads it onto
//!   the call's SIP ladder. See [`HepTelemetry::emit_call_lifecycle`];
//!   the admin `POST /admin/v1/hep/test` probe uses the lower-level
//!   [`HepTelemetry::emit_log`].
//!
//! - Node health, also as `Log` chunks: `node_started`, `node_ready`,
//!   `node_draining`, a periodic `node_status` and `node_stopping`, keyed
//!   by `node:<[node].id>` so Homer shows each node as its own timeline.
//!   See [`NodeHealthReporter`].
//!
//! `HepProtocol::Cdr` (0x65) chunks — the full CDR JSON emitted when a
//! call ends — are composed by `siphon-ai-cdr`'s `HepCdrSink`, which
//! shares this module's `HepSink` via [`HepTelemetry::sink`] rather
//! than duplicating the packet-composition here.
//!
//! Per CLAUDE.md §4.7 emission is best-effort, never blocking. The
//! underlying `UdpHepSink` drops on a full queue and counts it; a
//! sampler task here mirrors that count — and the wire-send count —
//! into [`HEP_PACKETS_DROPPED_TOTAL`] and [`HEP_PACKETS_SENT_TOTAL`]
//! so operators see degradation without the call path stalling.
//!
//! **An unreachable collector** (#596, closing the gap #460 left): the
//! sink also counts sends the socket refused
//! (`UdpHepSink::send_failures`), mirrored here as
//! `siphon_ai_hep_packets_dropped_total{reason="collector_down"}`, and
//! [`HEP_COLLECTOR_UP`] is derived from it each sample — `0` when any
//! send failed during the last interval, `1` otherwise. So every packet
//! handed to the sink is exactly one of sent / queue_full /
//! collector_down. The UDP caveat stands: a connected UDP socket only
//! learns a collector is dead from the ICMP port-unreachable it sends
//! back, so a *black-holed* collector (a firewall dropping silently)
//! still looks up — `sent` counts wire-level success, not delivery.
//! The throttled `hep_rs::udp` WARN remains, and the daemon's log
//! filter keeps a `warn` floor under every target so it is always
//! reachable (#597).
